# Mimas

A discord bot to manage automatically voice channels.

## Features

Mimas can:

- dynamically create new voice channels
- dynamically remove unnecessary voice channels
- keep your voice channels sorted as you designed

What does that mean?

As soon as a user joins an empty voice channel, Mimas will create an identical empty voice channel beneath (with same name).

When a voice channel is left by its last user, Mimas will remove it if necessary.

At any given time there will be an empty voice channel available, distinct by name.

Mimas will keep your Discord server tidy and clean, giving your community a neat user experience.
